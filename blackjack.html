    <h1 class = "page-section-header" > Understanding the Goal </h1>
    <div class="page-text"> The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Players compete against the dealer, not each other. </div>

    <h1 class = "page-section-header" > Card Values </h1>
    <div class="page-text"> Each card in the deck has a value. Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each. Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player. </div>

    <h1 class = "page-section-header" > Dealing Cards </h1>
    <div class="page-text">  The dealer deals two cards to each player, including themselves. Both of the player's cards are dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up and one card face down (known as the hole card). </div>

    <h1 class = "page-section-header" > Player's Turn </h1>
    <div class="page-text"> Players have several options:

      a. Hit: Take another card from the dealer. Players can hit as many times as they like, but if the total value of their hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round.

      b. Stand: Keep the current hand and end the turn.

      c. Double Down: Double the initial bet, take one more card, and then stand.

      d. Split: If the first two cards have the same value, the player can split them into two separate hands, each with its bet equal to the original bet. </div>

    <h1 class = "page-section-header" > Dealer's Turn </h1>
    <div class= "page-text"> Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until their hand reaches at least 17 points. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, all remaining players win. </div>

    <h1 class = "page-section-header" > Determining the Winner </h1>
    <div class="page-text"> After the dealer stands, the hands are compared. The player with a hand closer to 21 than the dealer's hand wins. If the player's hand is equal to the dealer's hand, it's a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned. </div>
